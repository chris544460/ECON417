Subject: Request for an extension on homework assignment

Prof Smith,

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to request a slight extension of the upcoming homework assignment. I understand that the deadline for the assignment is on Friday, but I was hoping to request submitting the homework on either Saturday or Sunday instead.

This week has been incredibly challenging for me. In addition to the midterms and project deadlines, I have been going through a difficult situation with my passport. As an international student from Venezuela, my embassy officials have left the US due to political tension, and unfortunately, I lost my passport. To resolve this issue, I have been in contact with immigration lawyers and embassy officials from different countries, which has been a time-consuming process.

Due to this situation, I have not been able to keep up with the expected workload, and I am worried that I won't be able to submit my homework on time. I would be grateful if I could have one or two extra days to complete the assignment, and submit it on either Saturday or Sunday.

I assure you that I am not taking this request lightly, and I understand the importance of meeting deadlines. However, given the circumstances, I believe that an extension will allow me to submit my best work without compromising my academic responsibilities. 

I have been putting in the work on this homework, but realistically I don't think I will be able to complete it on time. I am hoping that you will consider my request, and I will be happy to provide any additional information that you may need.

Thank you for your consideration, and I hope you can understand my situation. Please let me know if this request is possible.

Best,
Christian

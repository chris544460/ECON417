Hi Christian,

I read your steps carefully, and I think that they are good.

One comment: please try with small number of assets (e.g., 2 assets) first to understand the problem and the algorithm, and then increase the number of assets.

There might be analytical solution to this problem as well, such that you could compare it with your numerical solution.

Best regards,
Songyuan
